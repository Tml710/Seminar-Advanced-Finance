Title: Capital Structure and Market Valuation: Investigating the Role of Debt Financing

Authors: Christoffer Johne (HLW856) and Christopher Dyrling (TML710)

Description: 
We would like to delve into how debt financing impacts a company’s market value, where we will use Modigliani-Miller’s (MM) framework to look at this. Here MM’s framework highlights how under perfect conditions that the capital structure does not have any influence on the market value. However, in practice, companies face taxes, bankruptcy costs and information asymmetry that all have an effect on the optimal choice. Here we will include theories such as Trade-off and Pecking Order, which help explain observed leverage decisions. Trade-off theory suggests that firms weigh tax benefits of debt against the rising costs of financial distress, striving for an “optimal” debt ratio. Meanwhile, the Pecking Order perspective posits that companies first rely on internal funding, then debt, and resort to new equity issuance only as a last step, largely to minimize adverse signals to the market.
We will empirically investigate this, where we compare firms within the same industry with both high and low debt. For this we will use a panel of financial and market data, to see how different debt levels correlate with market valuation, based on the premise that there, in the perfect market described by MM, will be no correlation between market value and capital structure, but we in reality expect to see some deviation. Also, we will compare how different sectors characteristics are, such as asset tangibility and volatility, which can moderate the relationship between leverage and market value. Initially, we have thought of the two sectors being “Financials” and “Industrials”, where the debt intensity might be high for both sectors, but there is a difference in liquidity of assets. This choice of sectors might change.
The results will be able to highlight how capital structure decisions interact with market forces, suggesting that the optimal mix of debt and equity is neither universal nor static, but rather contingent on firm-specific conditions, industry norms, and broader economic factors.
